# Syntax-Highlighter
Syntax Highlighter for Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint (2010 and 2013 are tested).

The goal of this project is to build a syntax highlighter inside the Microsoft Office application suite.
The base of this implementation is to use an existing syntax highlighter (GeSHi [php]) to process the syntax highlighting. 
Current version of this add in for Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint communicate over the standard input and output stream 
with the GeSHi library.
